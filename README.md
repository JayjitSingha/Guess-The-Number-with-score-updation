# Guess-The-Number-with-score-updation
guessTheNumber.py is a python code for the game Guess The Number where the score will be updated on the leaderboard in the file 'score.txt'.
Note : in order to properly run this game and to be able to see the leaderboard, you need to make a folder in which you need to save this file as .py and another text file by the name 'score.txt'. Once done, you can open the folder in your respective editor(e.g. Visual Studio Code) and play the game by running the python code and have fun as much you want and compete with your friends while keeping track of the scores on the leaderboard.
